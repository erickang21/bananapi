So, hey banana, tnt.

You forgot about this permission, didn't you.
Well you are just lucky I am deciding not to destroy it like you did to DBB, Chat Noir.
Oh, dont know what I mean?

Well, look at that. You literally did the unthinkable. You know what, I'll give you a clap for that. Oh wait I can't, because this isnt Discord.

Just be glad the revolters don't try to make a new DBBH. I mean like, that would be impossible wouldn't it. It would be without TNT, CSS, and all that.
Well, next time try harder to stop me. Blacklisting me from your bot ain't gonna stop me. Blocking me and saying you are quitting Discord? Please, thats pathetic.

Also, so your server has been dead af, I know this. How? Oh, you forgot a bot of mine.

Whenever we meet again.
